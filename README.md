It was created for ARM architecture processors such as the Cortex A7, and it is written in the C++ language.

Two librairies are used:
- OpenCV (http://opencv.org/)
- RaspiCam (https://github.com/cedricve/raspicam)

They are open source.

Here is what you need:
- A Raspberry Pi B to detect and command servomotors
- A Raspberry Pi Camera to take screenshots of the environment
- A home-made electronic circuit to adjust the power
- A laser to point the ball
- 2 servomotors to control the x and y axis.
